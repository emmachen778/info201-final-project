## Conclusion

### Trends
* Housing sales and rentals are very seasonal, tending to peak in the summer. This led us to use the prophet API for our machine learning section because it is designed for seasonal data with many observations.
* Median sales and rental values are climbing back up and sometimes even exceeding the levels seen before the crash of 2008.
* Washington is one of the highest growing states in terms of housing prices, mainly driven by Seattle and the cities around it (Bellevue, Redmond, etc.). We can infer from this that the technological innovation in the area is driving up housing prices by bringing in highly paid technical workers.
* In Seattle, rental prices tend to increase steadily until September then crash after. We hypothesize this is due to college students tring to find housing before the quarter starts.

### Notable Outliers
* In some cities, predictions for median sale price are completely thrown off when the median sale prices jump to very large values:
    * Issaquah: In December 2013, the median sale price jumped to ~$12.5 million.
    * Auburn: In November 2013, the median sale price jumped to ~$4.12 million.
    * Kenmore: In June 2010, the median sale price jumped to ~$8.09 million.
* California is the highest state by far when it comes to median sale prices, but New York wins when it comes to median rental prices.
