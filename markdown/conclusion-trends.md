## Trends
* Housing sales and rentals are very seasonal, tending to peak in the summer. This led us to use the prophet API for our machine learning section because it is designed for seasonal data with many observations.
* Median sales and rental values are climbing back up and sometimes even exceeding the levels seen before the crash of 2008.
* Washington is one of the highest growing states in terms of housing prices, mainly driven by Seattle and the cities around it (Bellevue, Redmond, etc.). We can infer from this that the technological innovation in the area is driving up housing prices by bringing in highly paid technical workers.
* In Seattle, rental prices tend to increase steadily until September then crash after. We hypothesize this is due to college students tring to find housing before the quarter starts.
