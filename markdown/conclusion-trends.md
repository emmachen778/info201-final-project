## Trends
* Housing sales and rentals are very seasonal, tending to peak in the summer. States and cities that do have data tend to have many observations. This led us to use the prophet API for our machine learning section because it is designed for seasonal data with numerous data points.
* Median sales and rental values are climbing back up and sometimes even exceeding the levels seen before the housing market crash of 2008.
* Washington ranks in the highest group of states in terms of housing sale and rental growth in recent years. This is mainly driven by Seattle and the cities around it (Bellevue, Redmond, etc.). We can infer from these data points that the technological innovation in the area is driving up housing prices by bringing in highly paid technical workers.
* In Seattle, rental prices tend to increase steadily until September then crash after. We hypothesize this is due to college students in the area trying to find housing before the quarter starts.
